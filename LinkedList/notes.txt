arrray is used to store data
in array data is stored in contiguous manner in heap suppose 1st element is at index 100 then next element will surely be at 104 index and so on
but array is of fixed size su suppose if i have to add an element then it is a difficult task
but linked list doesnt store data in contiguous location 
we can store anything in ll similar to array like int,double,list,string,char,etc
there size can be increased at any moment
in case of array we were not sure that since its a contiguous location then will the next memory address available or not
but in ll it will find a place and store it
in ll we store data as well as next 
if we can somehow remember what is the next element then we are sorted
we remember the starting point and we call it as head
if there is nothing further to add than we will point it to nullptr and that node is called tail of linked list
so we can easily increase or decrease the size in ll
we can use it in stack queue where ll is used
in 1d ll we just have track of next element
in real life we use it in browser

<-             <-           <-    <-

in cpp you cannot store memory location for that we require pointer for that memory location to store it
we are storing data and pointer to the next
there is no data type that can help you to store two different things
thats why we require self defined data-type
if you write something like
Node* y=new Node(2,nullptr)
then in this case it will automatically store a pointer to the memory location
you have to keep track of ll so head will always point to 1st position
in question like ll they do not require you to return the whole ll they just want the head of ll
